This file contains notes about the captures found in this repo:


2019_Chevy_Equinox.log:
A limited test of a CAN capture on this vehicle. It conforms to the GM GLOBAL-A standard. 
This vehicle has rear radar, lane keeping, forward collision avoidance, adaptive cruise. 
So, a wide variety of GLOBAL-A messages should be found in this capture.
However, the vehicle was merely revved in a driveway and rolled backward and forward only
in the space of the driveway. This is not a full driving capture.


2012_Nissan_Leaf_Driving:
This fully electric car was driven around the block. It was shifted through the gears as well.
2012 Leafs use the original generation CAN data format.

Busmaster_Think_log.log:
Driving around in a Think City Electric car. I believe this was a 2011 or 2012 model. The
car is quite basic so don't expect anything self driving related or fancy. But, astute
observers should be able to find the usual suspects - wheel speeds, tire pressures,
RPM, battery voltage, etc.
